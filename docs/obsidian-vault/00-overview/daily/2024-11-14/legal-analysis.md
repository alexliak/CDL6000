# Daily Progress: Legal Text Classification Analysis

## Overview
Initial exploration of 24,985 legal cases dataset completed with baseline statistics and data validation.

## Data Analysis Results

### Dataset Statistics
- Total cases: 24,985
- Text completeness: 176 missing case texts identified
- Average text length: 2,650 characters
- Median length: 1,488 characters
- Maximum length: 133,561 characters

### Case Outcomes Distribution
cited: 12,219
referred to: 4,384
applied: 2,448
followed: 2,256
related: 113
affirmed: 113
approved: 108

## Technical Implementation
- [x] Project structure verified
- [x] Data loading pipeline established
- [x] Basic statistical analysis completed
- [x] Initial data quality assessment performed

## Code Executed
```python
# Core data loading and analysis
df = pd.read_csv("data/raw/legal_cases.csv")
df['text_length'] = df['case_text'].str.len()
```

## Issues & Solutions

### Resolved

- ✓ CSV path configuration
- ✓ Data loading verification
- ✓ Missing value identification

### Pending

- [ ]  Handle missing case texts
- [ ]  Implement text preprocessing
- [ ]  Develop citation extraction

## Next Actions

1. Text Preprocessing Pipeline
    - Tokenization implementation
    - Legal term extraction
    - Citation pattern analysis
2. Analysis Framework
    - Case relationship mapping
    - Legal principle identification
    - Similarity metrics development
