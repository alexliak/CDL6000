# CDL6000 Requirements Verification Matrix

## Assessment Requirements Coverage

### 1. Core Deliverables Verification
✓ Project Proposal (10%)
- Current Status: Partially covered in specifications
- Gap: Need explicit proposal document with research questions
- Action: Create `01-specs/project-proposal.md`

✓ Design Documents (10%)
- Current Status: Well covered in design document
- Strength: Architecture and flow well defined
- Note: Add more diagrams for clarity

✓ Experiments and Implementation (30%)
```yaml
Covered:
  - SVM implementation
  - Performance monitoring
  - Resource optimization
Missing:
  - Experiment tracking framework
  - Cross-validation setup
  - Baseline comparisons
```

✓ Weekly Log Requirements (20%)
```markdown
Current Structure:
/00-overview/daily/
└── 2024-11-13/
    ├── implementations-steps
    ├── documentation-workflow
    └── obsidian-appearance

Needed Addition:
/00-overview/weekly/
└── progress-tracking.md
```

### 2. Research Components Check
```yaml
Current Coverage:
  ✓ Technical Implementation
  ✓ System Architecture
  ✓ Performance Metrics

Missing Elements:
  ! Research Question Definition
  ! Literature Review Structure
  ! Experiment Design Framework
  ! Critical Analysis Framework
```

### 3. Critical Gaps to Address
1. Research Question Documentation
```markdown
Add to /01-specs/research-questions.md:
- Primary Question: Performance vs Accuracy
- Sub-questions: Resource Optimization
- Evaluation Criteria
```

2. Experiment Framework
```python
experiments/
├── baseline/
│   └── svm_baseline.py
├── optimization/
│   └── performance_tests.py
└── evaluation/
    └── metrics_tracking.py
```

3. Critical Analysis Structure
```markdown
/02-design/analysis-framework.md:
- Performance Analysis
- Resource Utilization
- Accuracy Metrics
- Implementation Challenges
```

## Immediate Actions Required

1. Create Research Foundation:
```bash
touch docs/obsidian-vault/01-specs/project-proposal.md
touch docs/obsidian-vault/01-specs/research-questions.md
touch docs/obsidian-vault/01-specs/literature-review.md
```

2. Setup Experiment Structure:
```bash
mkdir -p src/experiments/{baseline,optimization,evaluation}
touch src/experiments/baseline/svm_baseline.py
touch src/experiments/optimization/performance_tests.py
touch src/experiments/evaluation/metrics_tracking.py
```

3. Update Documentation:
```bash
# Weekly tracking
mkdir -p docs/obsidian-vault/00-overview/weekly
touch docs/obsidian-vault/00-overview/weekly/progress-tracking.md

# Analysis framework
touch docs/obsidian-vault/02-design/analysis-framework.md
```
