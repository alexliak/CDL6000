Status: Initial Draft
Path: /docs/obsidian-vault/01-specs/proposal.md

## 1. Research Question

### Primary Question
"How can we optimize SVM-based legal document classification to achieve >75% accuracy while maintaining sub-2-second processing time per document on consumer GPU hardware?"

### Sub-Questions
1. What is the optimal balance between processing speed and classification accuracy?
2. How can we effectively utilize GPU resources (RTX 3060) without exceeding 80% memory usage?
3. What preprocessing techniques are most effective for legal document classification?

## 2. Technical Objectives

### 2.1 Performance Targets
```yaml
Processing:
  Time: <2s per document
  Memory: <4.5GB RAM
  GPU: <80% utilization (RTX 3060 6GB)

Accuracy:
  Classification: >75%
  F1 Score: >0.74
  Precision: >0.75
  Recall: >0.75
```

### 2.2 Implementation Goals
1. Efficient document preprocessing pipeline
